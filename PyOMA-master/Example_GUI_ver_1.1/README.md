# Example 5-DOFs on PyOMA_GUI ver 1.1

The current folder contains the files necessary to reproduce the [5-DOFs identification problem](https://github.com/dagghe/PyOMA/tree/master/Example_ver_1.4) using the PyOMA_GUI software. 

The file

> 5DOF_example_Fs100Hz.txt

contains the time series vibration response coming from the 5-DOFs identification problem.

This is the same example analyzed in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101216).

The file

> Nodes3DCoord.txt

contains three dimensional nodes' coordinates, whereas the file

> Connectivity3D.txt

contains the connectivity matrix of the previously defined nodes.
