## Update version 1.1
* Minor bugs fixed in selecting identified peak frequencies;
* Minor bugs fixed in scale factor for visualizing deformed shape;
* Minor bugs fixed in general;
* Since GitHub does not allow pushing single files exceeding 100MB (total PyOMA_GUI.exe file is  104 MB) it is necessary to download the two archives and then extract on local machine.
