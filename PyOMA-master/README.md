# ATTENTION!!!
Dear users please check out our new release, [pyOMA2](https://github.com/dagghe/pyOMA2).

The main novelties introduced by the new release are:
- **Comprehensive Code Revision:** The underlying algorithms have undergone a thorough overhaul for more efficient and robust performance.
- **Specialized Class Structures:** Includes specialized classes for handling both single-setup and multi-setup measurements, enhancing data management versatility.
- **Interactive Plotting Feature:** An optional interactive plotting capability allows users to select desired modes directly from the algorithm's output plots, improving user interaction and mode selection.
- **Geometry Definition Option:** Additional feature for optional geometry definition to enable plotting and animation of mode shapes, providing a comprehensive understanding of results post-analysis.

This repository will be discontinued when the final release of pyOMA2 will be out!

# PyOMA
This software was created to perform output-only modal identification (Operational Modal Analysis, OMA).

OMA allows the experimental estimation of the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes, damping ratios) of a structure from measurements of the vibration response in operational condition.

## What is PyOMA?
PyOMA is a python module that allows to perform OMA on ambient vibration measurments datasets.

PyOMA include the following algorithms:

1. Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD)

	1a. Original Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD)
	
	2a. Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition (EFDD)
	
	3a. Frequency Spatial Domain Decomposition (FSDD)
	
2. Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI)

	2a. Covariance-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (cov-SSI)
	
	2b. Data-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (dat-SSI)	
	

To better untersdand the workflow of the functions, see the workflow [here](https://github.com/dagghe/PyOMA#workflow).


## Installing PyOMA
As a prerequisite to install PyOMA, you need to install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) first.
You should install a Python version greather equal 3.5 or the software may run in troubles.

To fully install PyOMA, you need to run the following commands (in the following order):

- pip install pandas

# What is PyOMA_GUI? A brief software overview

PyOMA_GUI is a graphical user interface software developed in [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), which implements in a single integrated tool the operational modal analysis of civil structures with output-only measurement data. This software utilises the aforementioned functionalities offered by the [PyOMA](https://github.com/dagghe/PyOMA) python module. Therefore, PyOMA_GUI provides a remarkably user-friendly interface to improve the accessibility of the PyOMA module, ensuring widespread usage both for scientists, researchers, and even for applied civil and structural engineers. The main features PyOMA_GUI provides are listed below:
- Importing data tab;
- Definition of the geometry of the structure and the monitoring system (channels and degrees of freedom, DOFs);
- Preprocessing of signals tool with detrending and decimation options;
- Dynamic identification algorithms with visualization of the results (graphs, modal shapes);
- Post-processing tabs and output exportation functionalities;

The executable file PyOMA_GUI.exe for windows is already available [here](PyOMA_GUI/).

A short manual to guide the user into an introductory example is available [here](PyOMA_GUI/PyOMA_GUI_user_manual_v1.0.pdf).
